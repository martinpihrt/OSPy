OSPy
###### **O**pen **S**prinkler **Py**thon
OSPy is a free Raspberry Pi based Python 3 program for controlling irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip, IoT, etc). This is my fork from [Rimco/OSPy](https://github.com/Rimco/OSPy) and [Dan-in-CA/SIP](https://github.com/Dan-in-CA/SIP) with My modifications.

## For translate OSPy to other language
The OSPy system is currently in three languages: English, Czech, Slovak. For other [languages](https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/tree/master/i18n) and step by step, how to use is typed in MD file
Any user who joins the "OSPy" project is welcome! Translation of strings into other languages is not demanding (using the [Poedit](https://poedit.net/))

## Communication with other systems
OSPy can be controlled and monitored using HTTP GET commands. With the addition of available plugins OSPy can communicate with other systems via MQTT. OSPy can also issue Linux shell commands when a station is turned on or off. This is useful for controlling wireless remote devices and for IÂ²C relay hats and boards. The Blinker package that is shipped with OSPy sends messages to other Python modules such as plugins to report changes in status. See the signaling examples file in OSPy's plugins folder for examples. Homeassistant integration via MQTT plugin.

## Sensors
OSPy allows to read data from wireless sensors (ESP32, ESP8266...) [Docs](https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/blob/master/hardware_pcb/sensors_pcb_fw/docs/Details.md)

## Remote Controller for OSPy based on M5stick-C 
This controller allows you to select a program stored in the OSPy on the LCD display and start it with the button. The controller is connected to the home Wi-Fi network. We do not even need a mobile phone or a computer to quickly select programs. We will use this miniature controller.
