martinpihrt - Signaling Examples<br/>
Updated the Signaling Examples plug-in to use a single complete signal list shared by code, settings, help, and README documentation. The settings page now refreshes status automatically and shows the last received signal in a separate auto-updating field.

martinpihrt - LCD Display, Wind Speed Monitor<br/>
Improved I2C bus cooperation between LCD Display and Wind Speed Monitor: Wind Speed Monitor now requests high-priority I2C access for PCF8583 counter setup and reads, while LCD Display uses low-priority short-timeout access so display scrolling does not delay time-sensitive measurements.
LCD Display now uses HD44780 display-shift commands for scrollable text that fits into the controller DDRAM buffer, reducing I2C traffic while preserving full long-text scrolling behavior for longer messages.
