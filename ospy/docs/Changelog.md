July 19 2024 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Added installation script for easier installation of OSPy. Now you just need to log into your Raspberry pi via SSH and run the script. The script will run the installation wizard and then download the necessary files. Finally, it will run OSPy. The installation is described at https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/tree/master/ospy/docs/Clean_installation.md. Support for loading graphs and logs from mysql database has been added to wind monitor and ups plugins.

July 17 2024 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
OSPy - updating the Czech language (new and updated strings) for new Shelly Cloud Integration plugin (data from devices such as temperature, humidity, consumption, status of outputs are loaded from the cloud of the device manufacturer Shelly... Furthermore, these devices will be integrated into OSPy sensors - they can be used for further use in the OSPy system). Fix in Database Connector plugin !removed mariadb and replaced with mysql-connector-python. Now working in the latest version of Linux Debian 12 Bbookworm and Python 3.11! Work is also underway on the MQTT home assistant plugin for integration into the HA system.

July 03 2024 (v3.0)
(martinpihrt)<br/>
-----------
OSPy - updating the Czech language (new and updated strings) for new MQTT Home Assistant plugin (So far only a broken test! Do not use!).

June 27 2024 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
OSPy - fixed installation error (sudo python3 setup.py install) cmarkgfm, added requirements, paho-mqtt, mariadb. Prepare for home assistant integration: (helpers - Fully qualified domain name, get rpi revision codes). Plugins - added logging dump from local file or sql database (graph and csv logs download at the same time) in Tank monitor. Report about HW board in system info plugin (example print: Raspberry Pi 2B with at least 1GB RAM!).

April 20 2024 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings) for new ospy backup plugin. Added new plugin "ospy backup". This extension creates a backup of data directories from all available installed extensions in OSPy. Example: "Air Temperature and Humidity Monitor/data". Local records from plugins (for example json files with temperature, etc...) are most often found in the plugins data directories. Backups can be downloaded to our computer (phone) and possibly uploaded back to data directories in specific plugins after unpacking. Backups are in zip format (example: 20240417-201606-PluginsBackup.zip. If possible, store all records from the plugins on to your own database storage (MySQL) instead of in local "data" directories. Not only does this save the Raspberry Pi SD card, but in the event of an OSPy crash, we won't lose the saved data (since it's outside of OSPy in the database). To connect to the database, we can use an extension called: database_connector. Which will ensure the storage of data from our plugins. Update OSPy webcore to latest: more-itertools 10.2.0, cheroot 10.0.0, jaraco.functools 4.0.1, web.py 0.62, jquery 3.7.1.min.js. The plugin "air temp humi" has now saving log into the local file (JSON) or to a remote MySQL database. Further plugins will also be supplemented. Fix in "database plugin". Backup correction in OSPy (if the backup was huge, the backup file in downloading fails).

February 22 2024 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language. Added new plugin "IP Scanner" and "Database Connector". Removing the AES key function from the sensor (now no longer required or verified by the AES key when sensor inserting data to the OSPy API). Pycrypto is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the ALGnew function in block_templace.c. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the python application. It was assigned the CVE-2013-7459 number. Now it will be easy to ported different HW boards such as OSPy sensors (for example ESP8266 - Sonof and more ...) The AES key is no longer available in OSPy settings and sensors settings. In the ESP32 sensor code, this item will also be removed in the next FW versions. OSPy tested on Raspberry Pi 5. Cleaning documentations (AES key). Example is here: https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy-plugins/blob/master/plugins/database_connector/static/images/test.png In the airtemp, windspeed, tank monitor extensions added saving to a sql database instead of saving to a local json file (the user can choose whether to save the data locally in OSPy, but this rapidly reduces the life of the SD card in the Raspberry Pi or to an external SQL database). In the future, the extensions will also include loading data from the SQL database (for graphs and recording...)

August 16 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings). Fixed wrong timestamp in API/logs. Canceling MQTT plugins (merging all functions into one MQTT plugin). When combining plugins with each other, MQTT did not work as it should. It is now resolved.

August 13 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings). Fix error in api/options. Fix error in MQTT run-once plugin. Add doc with images to MQTT run-once plugin.

August 11 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings). Added new plugin "Label Maker" (creation of EAN and QR codes for subsequent printing). Added post function to /api/runonce (Allows you to start the selected station for a set time. The duration is entered in seconds. For future use in the mobile application. More doc in OSPy help API Details.md.)

August 8 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings) for Proto plugin. Added new plugin "Proto". The proto plugin is designed as a starting point for creating new plugin for OSPy. It does not perform any useful action but contains the basic components necessary for a functioning plugin. More detailed information can be found directly in the plugin on the help page. In the weather.py, the loading of the location has been fixed even without the need to enter the api for stormglass, or the need to enable the stormglass service (the location is used by the CHMI plugin). Added display of data from plugins for display on stations timeline: which allow this (now for future use) alongside the countdown of station running time on the home page timeline. For example, flow in liters per minute, or engine speed (only if station status is ON). Example is here: https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/tree/master/ospy/images/show_sdata.png.

August 4 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>

-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings) for new CHMI plugin. Example is here: https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy-plugins/blob/master/plugins/chmi/static/images/meteomap.png. The plugin can detect whether it is raining in the set location from the weather radar and possibly set a rain delay.

July 26 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Updating the Czech language (new strings). Bug fixed: if the program is running and a time rain delay occurs, the station did not turn off.

July 25 2023 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Reworked automatic login (now you can set auto-login from different devices individually. Added a check box on the login page. Canceled in OSPy settings).

-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Fix in plugin "air temperature" (regulation time mm:ss) and added new function in plugin "pool heating" (safety shutdown. Simply put, if the temperature is higher and it takes xx minutes then it means that the pump is not running or that it is idling (no water). A fault e-mail is sent and the station is switched off permanently and automation is disabled.) Czech language strings update. Slovak language new strings update (via automatic Microsoft translator).

June 1 2022 (v3.0)

April 29 2022 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Fixed access to OSPy APIs in Python 3 (api crashed if login and password were required. In newer versions of python, the feature has been removed). This update fixes API access (for example, from an OLED M5Stick-C controller or another device). Fixed rounding numbers in Python 3 (to 2 decimal places). Concerned the display of water level settings (for example from the monthly water level plugin). Correction in the monthly water level plugin (if the user accidentally entered a decimal number instead of the whole one at the input, an error occurred during saving).

April 27 2022 (v3.0)

Czech language strings update, Slovak language new strings update (via automatic Microsoft translator). Voice notification plugin is now ready to use.

April 10 2022 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
From this update, OSPy versions will be counted again from 0 (the version will be 3.0.0), other commits are suppressed. Czech language update. All extensions for Python 2 and Python 3 have been tested (except the voice notification plugin -> it will be overwritten in the same way as the voice station plugin). Python 3 will be the default programming language for OSPy. Starting OSPy for Python 3 during installation is not yet resolved (service).

April 06 2022 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Transition from python 2 to python 3
1. Make an OSPy backup on the settings page (a zip file will be generated). The file contains a backup of the database and data from the sensors. We can use this backup to restore the system if necessary.
2. We will stop the ospy service "sudo service ospy stop"
3. Open the OSPy folder "cd OSPy"
4. We will uninstall the existing service "sudo python setup.py uninstall"
5. We will install the new service in Python 3 "sudo python3 setup.py install"
6. If there was a data folder and OSPy was ever run earlier in python 2, the database will be converted to python version 3 Attention: after running OSPy in python 3, it is no longer possible to run OSPy in python 2 again! If necessary, we will delete everything in the "data" folder. Then it is possible to run a clean version of OSPy in python 2 or 3 again.
Work on python 2 vs python 3 is not done yet!

April 05 2022 (v3.0)
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
The clean installation runs in both Python 2 and Python 3 (it seems no problem). Not all plugins have been tested in Python 3 (compatibility not yet done). Further work on OSPy and plugins continues. We do not recommend updating existing installations yet. Advanced users can try a clean installation and report any bugs.

March 24 2022 (v3.0)
-----------
(Rimco & martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
This OSPy update and all plugin updates are not in a stable phase (it is in testing and errors may occur). We do not recommend existing users to update their OSPy and plugins yet!!!
Many thanks to Rimco for converting the parts to Python 3.
1. Switched to Python 3. Python 2 should still be working, but no guarantees.<br/>
2. Moved options storage to separate folders to improve the handling regardless of storage backend. This update will take care of moving the existing options file.<br/>
3. Options stored in Python 2 are made forward compatible for Python 3. Make sure to run at least once more using Python 2 if you want to retain existing Python 2 settings.
(The old options.db in /data/ will not be touched after this update, so you can use it to manually recover if needed.)<br/>
Updating Czech language strings. Fix more bug (bruteforce lock time and login logic for users).

October 21 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Added new plugin "Voice station" You can upload any song with any name in mp3 and wav format to the song directory. Unlike the "voice notification" package, this extension has no connection to the station scheduler (ie how the programs and the stations assigned in them are set up). In this extension, the song will be played whenever the station status changes, regardless of what event the status triggered (for example, manual mode, scheduler, or some other plugin...). The extension of "voice notification" will also be adjusted in the future.Updating Czech language.

October 14 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
ESP32 firmware update version 1.18:<br/>
Added support for new hardware board HW:1.1 (multisensor by pihrt.com). New feture: two buttons for manual control for two relay. 2x LED for relays ON state. 1x LED for 3,3V power supply status. Contolling two relay via web server (from OSPy) instead one relay. Fixed: random clickering in relay (resistor in gate for FET 2N7002). Inductor package size on PCB. If GPIO4 and GPIO15 have pull-up resistors (state on GPIOs is on VCC 3,3V) then automatic detect and switch HW version to "1" HW1.1.<br/>
Added I2C (0x3c) OLED display 0,96" 128x64 (SSD1306) to display measured values from all inputs except humidity (DHTxx) and ultrasound (because these are on the I2C connector and cannot be used at the same time as the display) More: https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/blob/master/ospy/images/esp32_sensor_oled.png. OSPy: a description field for custom event naming has been added to the dry contact and motion sensor. Fixed: writing to the home page and logging to files in the sensors when the sensor is out of operation. Updating Slovak and Czech language.<br/>
New parameters for web:  
Example for on relay 1 to 400 second:  
http://192.168.88.207/0123456789abcdef?re=1&run=400  
For on relay 2 to 10 second:  
http://192.168.88.207/0123456789abcdef?re_2=1&run_r2=10

September 10 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Updating Slovak and Czech language. Moisture multigraph (completing the display of values from soil moisture probes in a multi graph). Sensor ESP32 - soil moisture (16 probes). Added label to each probe (you can assign your own name to probe 1-16). ESP32 firmware update version 1.17: Fixed bug in sensor "soil moisture". Tested with one ADS1115 converter (4 probes).

September 1 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Updating Slovak language (Thank you Tomáš Szepesi) and Czech language. In OSPy the option to rotate the sensing logic from the probe has been added to the ESP32 multi-sensor (soil moisture measurement) settings. Example: normal state 0V=0%, 3V=100%. Rotated state 0V=100%, 3V=0% humidity. TODO: moisture multigraph (it remains to complete the display of values from soil moisture sensors in a multi graph (currently only the first probe is displayed in the graph).

August 20 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Czech language update. 
Sensor ESP32 - soil moisture (16x probes): Added to all types of sensors - sending e-mails in case the sensor does not respond (or now again responds). On the OSPy side, soil moisture processing is complete (data reception, logging, adjustment of the running time of the selected program according to the humidity from the probe). The ESP32 sensor already sends data to the OSPy. It remains to test the connection of the A/D converter to the sensor ESP32 and verify the values of the transmitted voltage (I have not yet tested physically for the test -> hw is ordered). An image with the connection of probes to the ESP32 sensor has been added to the "create a new sensor" section (documentation on how to connect a specific sensor). Whoever already owns the ESP32 multi-sensor and has the ADS1115 converter together with a humidity probe (which has a voltage at the output in the range from 0 to max 5V), can test this functionality. Good luck with OSPy!

August 18 2021
-----------
(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Czech language update. 
Sensor ESP32 - soil moisture (16x probes): A window with program names and the time of their modification at runtime % has been added to the home page. If the sensor adjusts the time for the program below 100% of its set time, the window is visible. 100% from the soil moisture probe means that the program will not start. 50% of the soil moisture probe means that the program will only run for 50% of its set time. 10% of the soil moisture probe means that the program will only run for 90% of its set time. 0% of the soil moisture probe means that the program will run at 100% of its set time. Not ready for use!

(martinpihrt)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Czech language update. Sending values from OSPy sensors has been added to the "E-mail Notifications" extension (if you use sensors, you will see their values after the program is closed in the received e-mail). Two new signals have been added "internet_available and internet_not_available" for use within the system. At the same time, the failure and connection to the Internet (availability of an external IP address) is newly recorded in the event log. New signals have been added to the "signaling examples" extension. In the station section, the structure of the main stations has changed from check boxes to the selection window. A new item "Activate Master 1/2 by program" has been added for future new OSPy options - this function has not been completed yet. Selector: Activate Master? None - No master station will be used (when this station is activated, the master station will not be activated). Activate Master - If you want the master station (eg pump or main water valve) to be activated when a station is activated, select the "Activate Master". Activate Master Two - If you want the second master station (eg second pump or other water source) to be activated when a certain station is activated, select the "Activate Master Two". Activate Master 1/2 by program - If you want to select master station or master station two with a program, select the "Activate Master 1/2 by program". For a program, it is then possible to select which master station is to use for this station (example: program 1 controls stations 1-4 and master station 5. Program 2 controls stations 1-4 and second master station 6).<br/>
Important warning! After this update, you need to reassign the master stations to the stations (station page). If you are using master stations. Updated help in "help" section "Web Interface Guide - Czech.md and Web Interface Guide - English.md".

If the run parameter is not specified, it will be ignored). This is a good solution for possible shutdown of the relay in case of connection failure (example: OSPy switches the relay on the sensor board to ON for 4 minutes and then after time turns it OFF. If OSPy not send command for OFF, the sensor switches itself to OFF after 5 minutes) Fixed DS18B20 probe to 12 bit resolution (+- 0.0625C). Warning: after this update it will probably be necessary to settings your sensor via the AP manager.<br/>
OSPy: Added forms for future use of the ultrasonic sensors. Fixed bug in sensors. Fixed html css styles in sensors. Leak detector and ultrasonic sensor is not ready for use (i working on it). Updating Czech language (new strings for sensors).

Changes:<br/>
When adding a new sensor, the error in checking the MAC and IP address in the case of a radio sensor was fixed. The method of backing up the system OSPy has changed. Not only is the database file (options.db) saved, but the stations folder is also saved, where the station images are stored. At the same time, the events.log log file (if it exists) is saved. Everything is saved in a zip file (Example: ospy_backup_systemname_4.12.2020_18-40-20.zip). We can easily identify from which OSPy system the backup comes. The SSL folder where is the certificate is not stored for security reasons in to backup zip file! Restoring OSPy from zip file: The uploaded file must be zip file! The following paths and files must be in the:  
```bash
*.zip folder:
* ospy/data/events.log  
* ospy/data/options.db  
* ospy/data/options.db.bak  
* ospy/images/stations/station1.png  
* ospy/images/stations/station1_thumbnail.png 
``` 
Or other pictures of stations in the same format. Updating Czech language translate for changes. Newly, if we click on delete OSPy in the settings tab to the default settings, the files will be deleted: .pem in the /ssl folder. Next, events.log, options.db, and options.db.bak in the data folder.

Preparation for Python 3.
Stage 1 does not add any imports from the future package. The output of stage 1 will probably not (yet) run on Python 3.</br>
The goal for this stage is to create most of the diff for the entire porting process, but without introducing any bugs.</br>
It should be uncontroversial and safe to apply to every Python 2 package.</br>
The subsequent patches introducing Python 3 compatibility should then be shorter and easier to review.

July 22 2014
-----------
(Rimco)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
1. Split contents of the original ospi.py file into blocks that are more logical. (Should be improved even more.)<br/>
2. Removed numerous bugs regarding undeclared variables, unreachable code and misinterpretation of python classes. Tried to use python standards as much as possible.<br/>
3. Improved the way that plug-ins can adjust the water level. Each plug-in can now provide a water level adjustment which are combined by the main program.<br/>
4. Introduced template inheritance to solve many web-page inconsistencies and code duplication.<br/>
5. Fixed security issues where login-credentials were not checked. Introduced a ProtectedPage class as base class to be used for each page that should only be reachable if logged in.<br/>
6. Removed unused code, reduced code duplication.<br/>
7. Removed gv class (was not used at all) and put all global variables in the gv module itself.<br/>
8. Improved exception handling.<br/>
9. Because of the introduced template inheritance, plug-ins are now also using the same base template and are integrated better.<br/>
10. Improved page load speeds.<br/>
11. Added new weather-based water level adjustment plug-in that can change the water level depending on the history+forecast. This plug-in caches the queries made to WUnderground to reduce the number of queries, but a clean-up action needs to be added.<br/>
12. Removed files that should not committed to GitHub.<br/>
13. Removed APScheduler dependency.<br/>

July 11 2014

June 9 2014
-----------
(Dan)<br/>
Changes:<br/>
Software version 2.0
Jonathan Marsh's UI is now default under the master branch.

This revision also includes several bug fixes.

May 4 2014
-----------
(Dan)<br/>
Changes, bug fixes:<br/>
1. Program now explicitly sets all valves to off at startup. Fixes a bug that sometimes valves were on at program load.<br/>
2. Fixed a bug that could freeze the program under certain conditions if a station name was blank.<br/>
3. Changing station names would not be updated properly - Fixed.<br/>
4. Changed how ospi.py handles time and date. Changes such as to or from daylight time are now automatic. Time zone setting it options no longer has an effect.<br/>
5. Plugins must now have group permission set to executable in order to load. Allows plugins to be selectively enabled/disabled.<br/>
6. Removed deprecated "ospi_addon.py" file from program directory.

2. Modified the home.js file to show time zone info in the last run log near the bottom of the page.<br/>
3. Fixed a bug in concurrent mode that kept a station running after it's duration had expired.<br/>
4. Fixed a bug that would cause an exception (freeze the program) after the number of expansion boards was changed in Options.<br/>
5. Fixed a bug that would stop a running station and clear scheduled stations when the number of expansion boards was changed in Options.<br/>

September 10 2013
--------------
Additions, bug fixes:<br/>
1. Added a per-station "Ignore rain" option that allows a station to operate during rain delay or if a rain sensor detects rain.<br/>
2. Modified the program to use the HTTP port setting from the Options page.<br/>
3. Improved the way the program tracks current time. This simplified the code and should eliminate some timing bugs.<br/>
4. Edited Denny's init.d startup script to remove IP address and port settings no longer needed.<br/>

August 30 2013
--------------
Additions, bug fixes:<br/>
1. Modified the program to use only the time zone setting from the Options page and not the tz setting from the py.<br/>
2. Made the CPU temperature readout on the home page clickable to toggle between C and F.<br/>
3. Added a copy of Denny Fox's init.d auto startup script<br/>

August 25 2013
--------------
Additions, bug fixes:<br/>

August 1 2013 Reved to firmware V 1.8.3
---------------------------------------
Now supports concurrent operation.<br/>
Additions, bug fixes:<br/>
1. Added Sequential/Concurrent option.<br/>
2. Added a function to detect Pi board rev and auto-configure GPIO pins for rev 1 boards.<br/>
3. Fixed a bug in manual mode that would cause any zone with a master association to stop the master when turned off, even if another station with a master association was still running.<br/>
4. Changed how ospi.py handles master zone associations. The program should now work with more than 3 expansion boards (untested in hardware but at least 5 expansion boards, 64 stations work in software).<br/>

July 21 2013
------------
Bug fixes:<br/>
1. Fixed a bug that kept an in progress program running after it was disabled.<br/>
2. Added error checking to prevent an 'lg' KeyError<br/>
3. When a new program was added, it became program 1 instead of being added at the end of the list. - fixed.<br/>
4. When Rain Delay was set, running stations did not stop. - Fixed.<br/>
5. Added a 1.5s delay in the screen refresh of manual Mode to allow active stations and last run log time to update.<br/>

July 19 2013
------------
Code re-factored:<br/>
1. Eliminated over 100 lines of redundant code. The code is now much closer to the micro-controller version. Manual Mode and Run-once now rely on the main loop algorithm. This eliminates potential conflicts and makes the code easier to maintain. The program should now be more stable and have fewer bugs although the UI is a little slower.<br/>
2. Changed bit-wise operations to make them more reliable.<br/>
3. Station names now accept Unicode characters allowing names to be entered in any language.<br/>
4. Faveicon now appears on all pages.<br/>
5. A small bug in the display of Master valve off time in the program preview has been fixed. The off time was 1 minute short.<br/>
6. A file named 'sd_reference.txt' has been added to the OSPi directory. It contains a list with descriptions of the values contained in the global settings dictionary variable (gv.sd) which holds most settings for the program. These values are kept in memory and also stored in the file OSPi/data/sd.json to persist across system restarts. This is for the benefit of anyone who wishes to tinker with the code.<br/>

It is recommended to re-install the entire OSPi directory from GitHub. You can keep your current settings by saving the contents of the OSPi/data directory to another location before installation, then replace the contents of the newly installed directory with your saved files.

july 10 2013
------------
Bug fixes and additions:<br/>
1. Fixed a bug that prevented zones 9+ from running.<br/>
2. The Run once program was not observing the station delay setting - Fixed<br/>
3. Made the sd variable an attribute of the gv module. All references to sd... are now gv.sd... This should potentially fix several bugs, Specifically the Rain delay seems to be working properly now.<br/>
4. The Graph Programs time marker was not recognizing the time zone setting from the Options page - fixed.<br/>
5. Time displayed on the last run line of the main page was not correct - fixed.<br/>
6. Added a faveicon which will help distinguish the OpenSprinkler tabs on the browser.<br/>
7. Added an import statement and file which provide a stub for adding user written custom functions to the interval program without modifying the program itself.<br/>

Jun 26 2013
-----------
1. Last run logging is now working for manual mode when an optional time value is selected, even if more that one station is started.<br/>
2. Fixed a bug that prevented the home page display from updating when running irrigation programs.<br/>
3. Includes a fix from Samer that allows the program preview time marker to update properly.<br/>

Jun 20, 2013
------------
This update includes:<br/>
1. Changed the way ospi.py handles time. It now uses the time zone setting from the OS options page. It also eliminates the auto daylight savings time adjustment that was causing problems for some users.<br/>
2. Fixes a bug mentioned on the forum that caused Samer's app to not update in program mode.<br/>
3. Fixes a bug that caused a program to re-start after the "Stop all stations" button was clicked.<br/>
4. A partial fix for the "last run" problems. Still need to get manual mode with an optional time setting working.<br/>
5. Added a docstring at the top of the ospi.py file with the date for version tracking.

Jun 19, 2013
------------
  Applied Samer Albahra's patch so that the program will work with Samer's mobile web app.
