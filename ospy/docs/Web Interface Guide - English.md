# Options page
Use the Options page to configure system wide settings. 
The Options page includes several collapsible sections.
It opens with the System section expanded. Click a blue bar to open or close a section.

## System Section
The System section contains settings that identify the system and its local.

### Show Tooltips

* Click the SHOW TOOLTIPS button to display descriptive information about each option.
* Click the button to hide Tool tips.

### Set System name
Naming the system is useful when working with several controllers.

* Enter a unique descriptive name for the system.
* Click the Submit Changes button at the bottom of the page to save the change.

When the system name has been changed from OpenSprinkler Pi, the default, it will be displayed in the header of each page for easy system identification.

### Select System theme
There are several topics to choose from in the list (green mode, black and white mode...)

### Clock format
The 24-Hour clock option selects between the international 24 hour clock format, sometimes referred to as military time, and the 12 hour-AM/PM format.

* Uncheck the box to select the 12 hour, AM/PM format.
* Click the Submit Changes button at the bottom of the page to save the change.

You will be taken to the home page and the clock will be in the selected format.

### HTTP IP addr
IP Address used for HTTP/S server socket. IPv4 or IPv6 address (effective after reboot.) Default is 0.0.0.0.

#### About the port number 
The HTTP port number is part of the system's URL.
Port 80 is the default number for web sites and as such does not need to be included when the URL is entered into a browser's address bar. Many web servers use port 80 by default.
If you are running another server on the same Raspberry Pi as OSPy and using the same port number there will be a conflict and OSPy may not start.
You can avoid the conflict by changing OSPy's port number on the Options page to something like 8080. If you change the port number OSPy uses you will need to include that number, preceded by a colon, in the URL for OSPy's web interface. For example:
[URL of the Raspberry pi]:8080

### HTTP/S port
The HTTP/S port number is part of the system's URL. Port 80 is the default number for web pages.

* Click in the text field next to the HTTP/S port option.
* Type the port number you wish to use, e.g. 8080.
* Click the Commit Changes button at the bottom of the page.

You will be returned to the home page. The system will reboot but there is no visible indication of the reboot in the web interface. Wait at least 60 seconds, then add the new port number to the URL of the Pi, preceded by a colon (:), and try re-connecting to OSPy.

### Show plugins on home
If you want to display measured data from the extension (wind, temperature, level ...) on the home page, check the box. If we don't want to show data from the extension, we uncheck it.
* Please note that it is necessary to have the extension enabled and properly set in order for the data to be displayed correctly.

### Show sensors on home
If you want to display measured data from the sensors on the home page, check the box. If we don't want to show data from the sensors, we uncheck it.
* Please note that it is necessary to have the sensors enabled and properly set in order for the data to be displayed correctly.

### Select Language  
The language option can change the language used in the web interface.

* Click the downward arrow at the right of the language field to display a list of available languages.
* Click the language you wish to use in the interface.
* Click the Submit Changes button at the bottom of the page.

The software will restart and after a few seconds the interface will appear in the language selected.

### Show pictures at stations  
Select the check box to display images for the stations on the home page and the stations page.  

## Weather Section
The weather section allows you to access the weather forecast service for your location. You must register for this feature on the web (https://darksky.net/dev).
According to the weather forecast, the irrigation cycle can then be automatically adjusted (if we choose a plugin that uses the weather forecast).

### Use Weather
Enabling or disabling connection to service Dark Sky.

### Dark Sky API key
To make use of local weather conditions, a Dark Sky API key is needed.

### Location
City name or zip code. Used to determine location via OpenStreetMap for weather information.

### Elevation
Elevation of this location in meters. (need not be filled)

## Users Section
Here is the credentials of a system administrator (main user) who can manage the entire system.
For improved security it is recommended that you change the system password from the default opendoor and user name default admin. You can also disable the password requirement if desired.

* Click the triangle at the left of the bar labled Change password to expand the section.
* Check the "No password" box if you have a very good reason to disable password and name protection. The system will no longer require the user to log in. Access to all sections will be allowed.
* Enter your login name the the boxes labeled Administrator name.
* Enter the current password in the first text box This will be opendoor on a new installation.
* Enter your new password into the the boxes labeled New password and Confirm password.
* Click the Submit Changes button at the bottom of the page.
You will return to the home page. Your new password and name will be required the next time you log in.

### Disable security
Leave the Disable security box unchecked unless you have a very good reason to disable password protection.

### Login name
Enter the Login name. This will be admin on a new installation.

### Current password
Enter the current password in the first text box. This will be opendoor on a new installation.

### New password
Enter your new password into the the boxes labeled New password.

### Confirm password           
Enter your Confirm into the the boxes labeled Confirm password.

### Aditional users
After clicking on the button, a page will open where we can create and possibly edit new users to access the system.

## Security Section
In this section you can customize a secure connection using SSL and a certificate.

### Use HTTPS access 
If we have configured the OSPy server for enhanced security of SSL data transmission, select the "Use HTTPS" checkbox. If the "Use HTTPS" option is checked and the server is not set up correctly, OSPy will run as an http server without security.

### Domain Name
The certificate is located on the system in the '/etc/letsencrypt/live/' domain name '/fullchain.pem' and '/etc/letsencrypt/live/' domain name '/privkey.pem' directories. It is necessary to install the certificate manually into the system (Linux) using the "Certbot" tool (the use of https will not be reflected in OSPy until the OSPy is restarted).
* The procedure for installing Certificate Services can be found in the "Readme" help file or on Github.

### Use Certbot
For using "https" in OSPy options you must follow these procedures. SSL certificate via Let’s Encrypt certification authority.
The Certbot (https://certbot.eff.org/) and Let’s Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/) for enabling SSL security.

Execute:
```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

```bash
certbot --version
```

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your_domain_name
```

```bash
sudo certbot renew
```

```bash
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/fullchain.pem /home/pi/OSPy/ssl
```

```bash
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain.com/privkey.pem /home/pi/OSPy/ssl
```

```bash
sudo service ospy restart
```

### Use Own HTTPS access
If "Use Own HTTPS access" is selected in OSPy settings, file: fullchain.pem and privkey.pem must You insert to folder ssl in OSPy location. Warning: OSPy must be next restarted.
For manual generating certificate example:
```bash
sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -out fullchain.pem -keyout privkey.pem  
```

The second way is to use the "generate" button in the SSL certificate tab.

## Sensors Section
The Sensors section contains settings for sensors security.  

### Password for uploading
Password for uploading firmware from OSPy to sensor (for all used sensors - the same password must be used in sensor options.) Default is: "fg4s5b.s,trr7sw8sgyvrDfg".

### AES key for sensors
AES key for sensors. The length must be 16 characters (for all sensors used - the same code must be used in the Arduino code in the sensor.)

### Generate new key
After pressing the button, a new random 16-digit key is generated for use in the sensors.

## Station Handling Section
The Station Handling section contains settings for stations.

### Maximum usage
Determines how the stations combine. Concurrency 0 or sequential >= 1 (2, 3 ...) If all stations have sequential use.

#### About Sequential and Concurrent modes
* When setting the sequence (Maximum usage > = 1), only one (or more stations if set> = 1) station (output) - for example: main station 1 and station 3 flower beds is always started. After the program time has elapsed, the main station 1 and the station 3 turn off. The main station 1 and the station 4 lawn will start. The two stations (for example, the flower beds and the lawn shown in our example) will never sleep together. Sequence mode is important if we do not have such a water source (pressure and water quantity) available to cover all stations simultaneously.
* When you set up concurrency (Maximum usage = 0), an unlimited number of stations are set to run at any given time. For example, the main station 1 (pump) and the stations 2, 3, 4 are switched on. Concurrent irrigation reduces the irrigation time but requires a larger water source.

### Number of outputs
The total number of outputs available is (8 outputs + x extension board.) The number of outputs can be set higher than we actually have the number of physical outputs (we create the virtual outputs).

### Station delay
Enter the number of seconds to delay between station operations. Time in seconds between 0 and 3600.

### Minimum runtime
Skip station delay if run time is less than this value (in seconds) between 0 and 86400.

## Configure Master Section
The section "Configure Master Section" contains settings for all master stations. The master station is activated when any station is activated.
* The master station is a pump or the main valve with water as the water supply to the system.

### Master station
Selection of the first main station (for pump or main valve).

### Master two station
Selection of the next main station (for pump 2 or main valve 2).

### Activate relay
If checked, the relay will also be activated as the main output. The relay has activating from first or second master stations.

### Master on delay
Delay ON for master station (in seconds), between -1800 and +1800.

### Master off delay
Delay OFF for master station (in seconds), between -1800 and +1800.

### Master two on delay
Delay ON for master two station (in seconds), between -1800 and +1800.

### Master two off delay 
Delay OFF for master two station (in seconds), between -1800 and +1800.

## Rain Sensor Section
Enable and set the switch type of a rain sensor. If you are using a Raspberry Pi and want to connect a Rain Sensor directly to the GPIO pins use pins 8 and 6 (ground).

### Use rain sensor
Click the Use rain sensor check box to enable rain sensing.

### Normally open
Leave the Normally open box checked if your sensor's switch is the normally open type otherwise un check the box. See the rain sensor's user guide for information about the switch type.

### Enable debug log
Click the Enable debug log for saving all internal operation in OSPy to file for better debugging. *Note:* storing data too frequently in a file can damage the SD card or reduce the capacity of the SD card (storage) after a long time.

## System Restart Section
The System Restart section contains buttons for restarting the software, for rebooting the hardware, for shuttdown the hardware and delete all setings to default.

### Restart
The Restart button restarts the software only. It is a quick way to implement siftware changes.

### Reboot
The Reboot button reboots the Raspberry Pi. This takes longer but does a complete restart of the system.

### Shutdown
The Shutdown button shutting power the Raspberry Pi hardware.

### Default 
The Default button clears all custom user settings to the default clean OSPy installation.

## System Backup Section
If we want to back up all the settings of our irrigation system or transfer the settings to another system, we will use the "Download" and "Upload" button. 

### Download
The Download button is used to download the configuration file to your computer for later use or to restore the OSPy system. Not only is the database file (options.db) saved, but the stations folder is also saved, where the station images are stored. At the same time, the events.log log file (if it exists) is saved. Everything is saved in a zip file (Example: ospy_backup_systemname_4.12.2020_18-40-20.zip). We can easily identify from which OSPy system the backup comes. The SSL folder where is the certificate is not stored for security reasons in to backup zip file!

### Upload 
The Upload button allows you to insert and restore OSPy system (for example, when you reinstall a Linux system). The uploaded file must be zip file! The following paths and files must be in the

```bash
*.zip folder:
ospy/data/events.log  
ospy/data/options.db  
ospy/data/options.db.bak  
ospy/images/stations/station1.png  
ospy/images/stations/station1_thumbnail.png 
``` 
Or other pictures of stations in the same format.

## SSL Certificate
If we have our own SSL (https) security certificate (fullchain.pem and privkey.pem) we can upload it here using the form.

## Generate
If we want to generate an SSL certificate, press the "generate" button. A certificate is generated in the ssl directory. Then in the settings/security we check the "own HTTPS" option and then restart the OSPy.

### Upload
The "Upload" button sends the attached files (fullchain.pem and privkey.pem) to the ssl folder in the OSPy directory.

# Stations page
On the "Stations" page, we set the names of stations, properties around the use of water, control of the master stations.

## Station 
Automatic numbering to mark stations. For example 1 = station 1, 2 = station 2...

## Name
User name of stations for better identification in the system, for example "lawn".

## Usage
Set concurrency (0) or sequence (> = 1) for certain stations. More about concurrency or sequence in the text above in the section "Settings / About sequential and concurrent modes".

## Precipitation
The amount of water per hour in mm that atomises the sprinklers at the station. Used for weather-based programs. To measure this value, it is advisable to obtain, for example, a plastic rain gauge.

## Capacity
The amount of water that the soil can store above level 0. Used for weather-based programs.

## ETo factor
Factor used to multiply the ETo factor for weather-based programs. Use a value higher than 1 for sunny / dry soil, use a value lower than 1 for shade / wet soil.
* Type of soil

Soils have different properties that make them unique. Knowing the type of soil you have will help you identify its strengths and weaknesses. While soil consists of many elements, the place to start is with your soil type. You only need to monitor the composition of the soil particles. OSPy allows users to determine the soil type for each zone (station), allowing for more accurate and efficient watering calculations. Different soil types react differently to water; clay soils tend to drain, while clay soils can retain water for a long time, etc. The amount of water contained in the soil after the excess water is drained and the soil retention capacity is referred to as field capacity (measured in inches or millimeters).

### Bottle test
How to find approximate proportions of sand, mud and clay? This is a simple test that will give you a general idea of â€‹â€‹the proportions of sand, mud and clay present in the soil. Place 5 cm of soil in the bottle and fill with water.
Mix the water and soil well, remove the bottle and do not touch it for an hour. After an hour the water becomes clear and you will see that larger particles have settled:

- Pieces of organic matter may float on the water surface
- There's a layer of clay on top.
If the water is still not clear, it is because some of the finest clays are still mixed with water
- In the middle is a layer of mud
- There is a layer of sand at the bottom

* Measure the depth of sand, mud and clay and estimate their approximate ratio.

The following three types of particles can form your soil: clay, sand and mud. Most soils are a combination of these three particles, but the type of particle that dominates dictates many of the properties of your soil. The ratio of these sizes determines the type of soil: clay, clay, clay, mud, etc.

* Ideal soil is 40% sand, 40% mud and 20% clay. This mixture is referred to as aluminum. It takes the best of any type of soil particles. It has good drainage of water and allows air to penetrate the soil like sand, but also maintains moisture well and is fertile as mud and clay.

## Balance adjustment
Increase or decrease the water balance for weather-based programs (unless set to 0).

## Connected
If we have a station connected (it is physically connected) and we want to use it (it is visible in the selection in the programs, on the homepage ...), check "Connected". If you do not use the station and do not want to publish in the OSPy system leave the "Connected" unchecked. If a station is used as "master station" or "2 master stations" in the system, it cannot be checked or unchecked (deactivated) in the table.
The main station is assigned in the system settings "Options / master station".

## Ignore Rain
If you check "Ignore Rain" for a station, the station will be activated according to the program regardless of whether the rain delay is set or whether the rain sensor detects rain. We can use this option, for example: in a greenhouse where it does not rain and we need to water it regularly or, for example: to trigger pool filtration, which we also clean regardless of whether it rains.

## Activate Master?
### None
No master station will be used (when this station is activated, the master station will not be activated).
### Activate Master
If you want the master station (eg pump or main water valve) to be activated when a station is activated, select the "Activate Master".
### Activate Master Two
If you want the second master station (eg second pump or other water source) to be activated when a certain station is activated, select the "Activate Master Two".
### Activate Master 1/2 by program
If you want to select master station or master station two with a program, select the "Activate Master 1/2 by program". For a program, it is then possible to select which master station is to use for this station (example: program 1 controls stations 1-4 and master station 5. Program 2 controls stations 1-4 and second master station 6).

## Notes  
Notes are for operating the OSPy system. It can be noted for example: what types of el. valve, sprinkler etc. we have used in the system.

## Image
After clicking on the window, a page will open on which you can upload your own image to the station.
